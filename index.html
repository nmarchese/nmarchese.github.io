		  <h1> '=' vs. '==' </h1>
		    <p>
			- Typically, = is used to assign a value to a variable. Specifically, what is on the right of = will be assigned to what is on the left of it.
			- On the other hand, == is used to compaire two values or variables to eachother. Specifically == checks if the values on either side are equal to eachohter.

		  <h1> 'for,' 'while,' 'do while' </h1>
		    <p>
		    - A 'for' loop is used to repeat an operation a specific number of times defined in the parameters of the for loop.
		    - A 'while' loop is a loop where the contents of the loop only run if the condition of the while loop is true. If the condition is false, the entire contents of the loop will be skipped. If the loop does run, when the program gets to the end of the loop it goes back up to the top of the loop and checks the condition again. While the condition remains to be true the loop will continue to repeat.
		    - A 'do while' loop is very similar to a 'while' loop, except that the contents of a do while loop will always run the first time, and then repeat if the condition of the loop is true.
