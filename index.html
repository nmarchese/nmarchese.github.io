		  <h2 > '=' vs. '==' </h2>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Typically, = is used to assign a value to a variable. Specifically, what is on the right of = will be assigned to what is on the left of it.</li>
			  <li>On the other hand, == is used to compare two values or variables to eachother. Specifically == checks if the values on either side are equal to eachother.</li>

		  <h2> <em>for</em>, <em>while</em>, <em>do while</em> </h2>
		    <ul>
		      <li>A 'for' loop is used to repeat an operation a specific number of times defined in the parameters of the for loop.</li>
		      <li>A 'while' loop is a loop where the contents of the loop only run if the condition of the while loop is true. If the condition is false, the entire contents of the loop will be skipped. If the loop does run, when the program gets to the end of the loop it goes back up to the top of the loop and checks the condition again. While the condition remains to be true the loop will continue to repeat.</li>
		      <li>A 'do while' loop is very similar to a 'while' loop, except that the contents of a do while loop will always run the first time, and then repeat if the condition of the loop is true.</li>

		  <h2><em>swith</em> vs. <em>if/else</em></h2>
		    <ul>
		      <li>A 'switch' statement has a single variable that it compares to a list of every possible 'case' looking for a match. Each case (on the left) has a ':' after it seperating it from code to the right. There are also 'break's after the cases (sometimes after every case, sometimes after several). When the switch statement finds a case that matches its variable it moves to the code to the right of the ':'s and continues to run the code on the right untill it reaches a break.</li>
		      <li>'if/else' statements are pretty versitile depending on how they are used. An 'if' or 'else if' statement has a condition that determins whether it will run or not. Usually the condition is a comparison between two values (==, !=, >, etc.). If several 'if' statements are used, many bits of code can all run, depending on the conditions of each if. Using 'else if' statements can ensure that only the first statement that is true runs.</li>
		      <li>A 'switch' statement could better than an if statement if you want the same code to run for multiple possible conditions, since you can have many 'case's and then one block of code that runs if any of them match the condition. 'if' or 'else if' are a little more versitile and can be used to accomplish many different things, such as running many different blocks of code if they are each true, or just the first that is true, or some combanation.</li>

		  <h2>casting a <em>double</em> to an <em>int</em></h2>
		    <ul>
		       <li>To cast a 'double' to an 'int' you can use this: <em>int a = (int)double</em>. What this does is change whatever the <em>double</em> was (let's use 2.7 as an example) into an <em>int</em> and then store that value in the int variable 'a'. Since an <em>int</em> can't have a decimal doing this simply drops the decimal point and whatever value was after it (2.7 becomes 2). One example of a time that you would do this is if you had done some math that resulted in a number that is a <em>double</em> but you need it in the form of an <em>int</em> for use elsewhere in the program.</li>

		  <h2><em>void</em> vs. return types</h2>
		    <ul>
		      <li><em>void</em> is used when a function doesn't return a value.</li>
		      <li>If a funtion does need to return a value then the type of value that is to be returned would be used in place of <em>void</em>.(i.e. <em>int</em>, <em>double</em>, etc.)</li>
